    <p>Coding so very fun.Once you understand how to do it you will be doing it evry second.Just like architecture, which is an art used by people daily and affects their everyday life, so is code. You can create something and people interact with, use, touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling.Since code is a usable art, a whole team of people are connected to the practice. From the client to the account managers, and including the business people, finance, the support team, QA team, designers, product managers and project managers.</p>

<h1>What is coding?</h1>
<div class="line"></div>
<p> A set of instructions written in human readable language (at least to developers) that is executed to perform a task or goal. "what a programming language is" High level: Just like any language that exists in the world today, it has it's own alphabet, syntax and grammar that is for communication</p>
